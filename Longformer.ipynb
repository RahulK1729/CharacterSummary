of the normal Longformer model because the LED model supports Seq2Seq tasks with long input.\n","*   We train the LED model on LiSCU data which contains character names, summaries, and character descriptions.\n","*   At the end, we generate new inputs on unseen books.\n","\n","\n","Input: character name and summary  \n","output: description  \n","Train on
